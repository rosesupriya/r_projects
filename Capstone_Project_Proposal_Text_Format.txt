		Rossman Store Sales (Kaggle Competitions)
		
		For the capstone project, I would like to address the challenge of Rossmann Stores forecasting daily sales for up to six weeks in advance, that is currently posted on Kaggle competitions.
		
		Rossmann stores located across Germany and other European countries has posted a Kaggle challenge to help predict daily sales for up to 6 weeks for over 1000 stores. Since store sales have many variables affecting them, understanding sales data and creating a prediction model would help individual store managers to increase their sales.

		Rossman sales data is available from Kaggle website -
		(https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

		Rossmann sales and stores data is made available in 2 data sets. After tidying and wrangling the data sets, likely combining them into a single tidy data set,  I plan to apply different techniques of data analysis to understand and extrapolate the historical sales data to a robust and profitable prediction model.

		I plan to submit R scripts with accompanying paper.
